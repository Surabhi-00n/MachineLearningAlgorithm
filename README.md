Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.The intelligent systems built on machine learning algorithms have the capability to learn from past experience or historical data.Here we are considering a dataset task_1.csv for predicting a score of a student , percentage based on the no.of hours.
